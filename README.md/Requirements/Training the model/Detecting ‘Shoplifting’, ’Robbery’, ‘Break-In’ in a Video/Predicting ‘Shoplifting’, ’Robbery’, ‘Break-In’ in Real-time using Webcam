# Abnormal-Activity-Detection

ADAG (Activity Detector and Alert Generator) aims to take real-time videos from CCTV as an input and pass it to the CNN model created with the help of transfer learning and detect ‘Shoplifting’, ‘Robbery’ or ’Break-In’ in the store and notify it to the owners as soon as it occurs. Finally the main motive is to provide a system that detects suspicious activities without human intervention and generates alert, thus making a huge revolution in today’s surveillance system.
